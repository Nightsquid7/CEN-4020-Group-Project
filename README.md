## CEN-4020-Group-Project

Hey y'all, 

Decided to make this github page So that we can keep things organized.

I also think that it will be good practice for us in the beginning to use git/github before we start coding. 

Everyone will need to log with github in here, and we will make sure users all have administrative privileges.
Feel free to change any of this... 

Files so far: 
* Plan.md - the master plan for things we need to get done
        - so far this is just a  markdown file. we may eventually want to use 
        a different method to keep track of tasks..
* HowTo.md - A file containing some simple guides to do different project related things..
* README.md - this file
* Game ideas - I know we already have some google docs.. Perhaps we will replace this file with that?

Eventually I'm thinking we can use this repository to also store our code. We can create directory for that when the time comes!



## Team Members

* Daniel Powley
* Wendy Slattery
* Luca Labruna
* Sheikh Khaled
* Steven Berkowitz

# Best Practices (in order of priority high to low)
 * Any ideas for best practices? add them here please, no PR neccecary!
 * Feel free to update the other files without PR..
 * Eventually when we are writing  code, it will be nice if each member could rebase their commits before pushing to the github. We don't need to worry about this right now though..
 
 Some take-aways from my previous group project....
 1. Progress in bite sized goals accomplishing those tasks first before building upon them.
 2. Double up on duties, yet also diversely (prevents dependency on one person, two heads better than one, and keeps us involved in    broad scope of program so parts mesh better as well as learning more skills)
 3. Have a schedule (as Steven suggested) and clear duties distributed, otherwise you won't finish timely.
 4. Have goals, but be flexible...always those unforeseen barriers to progress
 5. Goal is basic functionality of program as a whole and then add features upon that
